## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔎 PCB Defect Detection using Computer Vision (YOLOv8)
- Trained a **YOLOv8** model on a custom **9-class PCB defect dataset**; achieved **Precision 0.90 / Recall 0.90 / F1 0.89** on the test set. 
- Improved robustness using data augmentation (rotation, flipping, noise) and **mosaic augmentation** for varied PCB patterns. 
- Built a real-time inference pipeline with **OpenCV preprocessing + bounding-box visualization**, and created a simple app for image upload and detection.

### 🏥 Healthcare Insurance Analytics & Predictive Pricing System
- Modeled medical cost and risk drivers using **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost** for expense prediction and risk classification. 
- Identified pricing misalignment (**low-risk overcharged ~19%, high-risk underpriced ~83%**) and translated findings into dashboards for decision-making. 
- Built **Power BI** visuals to communicate model outputs and risk-sensitive pricing insights to stakeholders. 

### 📦 Demand Forecasting for Inventory Management
- Built an end-to-end forecasting pipeline in Python (data cleaning, integration, preprocessing) for inventory management. 
- Performed EDA to identify seasonality, trends, and demand drivers; created visualizations to communicate insights. 
- Developed and compared **ARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM** models; evaluated using **MAE/RMSE/MAPE** to recommend the best approach.

## 💼 Experience

### Space Applications Centre, ISRO — Research Intern (Dec 2024 – Apr 2025)
- Designed high-density **RF ASIC multilayer PCBs (8-layer)** from provided schematics under strict size constraints (~50 cm × 60 cm). 
- Used **Keysight ADS (Advanced Design System)** to interpret RF schematic intent and guide RF-aware layout decisions. 
- Performed **LVS (Layout Versus Schematic)** verification before release for fabrication. 
- Delivered **5 end-to-end PCB design cycles** (layout → LVS → thermal review → QA checks → fabrication) while coordinating with Thermal and QA teams. 

### NIT Rourkela — Research Intern (May 2023 – Jul 2023)
- Designed and optimized RF antennas for 6G using **Ansys (HFSS/EM tools)** via parametric sweeps. 
- Analyzed effects on antenna performance (S11/return loss, bandwidth, gain) and documented results into a structured design dataset. 
- Validated simulations using **MATLAB Antenna Toolbox**, comparing MATLAB vs Ansys trends and accuracy.
