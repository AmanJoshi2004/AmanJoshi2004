## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔎 PCB Defect Detection using Computer Vision (YOLOv8)
- Trained a **YOLOv8** model on a custom **9-class PCB defect dataset**; achieved **Precision 0.90 / Recall 0.90 / F1 0.89** on the test set. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Improved robustness using data augmentation (rotation, flipping, noise) and **mosaic augmentation** for varied PCB patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- Built a real-time inference pipeline with **OpenCV preprocessing + bounding-box visualization**, and created a simple app for image upload and detection. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 🏥 Healthcare Insurance Analytics & Predictive Pricing System
- Modeled medical cost and risk drivers using **Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost** for expense prediction and risk classification. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Identified pricing misalignment (**low-risk overcharged ~19%, high-risk underpriced ~83%**) and translated findings into dashboards for decision-making. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- Built **Power BI** visuals to communicate model outputs and risk-sensitive pricing insights to stakeholders. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### 📦 Demand Forecasting for Inventory Management
- Built an end-to-end forecasting pipeline in Python (data cleaning, integration, preprocessing) for inventory management. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- Performed EDA to identify seasonality, trends, and demand drivers; created visualizations to communicate insights. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- Developed and compared **ARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM** models; evaluated using **MAE/RMSE/MAPE** to recommend the best approach. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
